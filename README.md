Vehicle Suspension and dynamics simulation in MATLAB and Simulink

This repo consists of my work on an all terrain BAJA vehicle. 
The suspension model was made in Simulink using rigid body toolbox to try different suspension motion for the vehicle
The performance model is also built in Simulink to iterate through various CVT ratios, gearbox ration to get maximum acceleartion and performance.
